          <h2>Krave</h2>
          <p>
            Krave is a chocolate cereal made by the Kellogg Company, launched in the UK in 2010 and marketed under the slogan "Taste
            Unleashed", later "Here Choccy Choccy" or "It's Time To Melt".
          </p>
          <p>
            Krave is crunchy without being exceedingly so (think Chex or Lays potato chips rather than Cap'n Crunch or kettle chips), and
            the outer shell's lightly crunchy texture and its lightly sweetened taste work well together.
          </p>

          <h2>Cinnamon Toast Crunch</h2>
          <p>
            Cinnamon Toast Crunch, known as Croque-Cannelle in French Canada and Curiously Cinnamon in the UK (previously Cinnamon Grahams),
            is a brand of breakfast cereal produced by General Mills and Nestlé.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Cinnamon Toast Crunch can be criticized for getting soggy quickly in milk, it's not that big of an issue because it still
            tastes really good even when it's soggy.

            The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the third and final installment in the series of games developed by CD Projekt RED featuring the
            witcher Geralt of Rivia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike the previous games of the trilogy, The Witcher 3 is set in a multi-region open world, featuring over 100 hours of
            content. Several early articles mentioned that the developers planned to have an open world similar to that of Skyrim, but 20%
            larger.
